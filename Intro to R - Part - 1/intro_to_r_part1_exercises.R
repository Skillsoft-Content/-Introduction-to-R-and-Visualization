#================================================
#### Question 8 ####

# Make a variable called `var_1` and let it be equal to a sum of 100 and 65.
# Make a variable called `var_2` and let it be equal a product of 3 and 1/2.
# Hint: when you create a new variable, make sure you view what it is equal to 
# in console and / or environment pane.

# Answer:



#================================================
#### Question 9 ####

# Make a variable called `var_3`, which is a result of division of `var_1` by `var_2`.
# Make a variable called `var_4` and set it equal to 110.

# Answer:




#================================================
#### Question 10 ####

# Compare `var_4` to `var_3`. Are they equal?
# Compare `var_1` to `var_4`. Is `var_4` greater than `var_1`?

#### Exercise 2 ####
# =================================================-



#================================================
#### Question 1 ####

# Create a logical variable named `logvar` and assign it the value FALSE.
# Confirm the type of variable for logvar.
# Then convert the logical variable to a character variable named `new_char2`.
# Check the value of the new variable in the Global Environment. 
# Then confirm the class of the new variable.

# Answer: 



#================================================-
#### Question 2 ####

test = 234.3

# What is the class of the `test` variable?
# What is the type of the `test` variable?
# Convert `test` to an `integer` and assign it to variable `test2`.
# Then confirm the new class of `test2`.

# Answer: 





#### Exercise 3 ####
# =================================================-


#================================================-
#### Question 1 ####

# Create a numeric vector named `numvec` that contains the values 2.3, 4, 5.63, and 4.623.
# Return the values of `numvec`.
# Convert the vector `numvec` to a vector of integers named `intvec`.
# Then confirm if the vector contains integers or not. 
# The answer should be either TRUE or FALSE.

# Answer: 




#================================================-
#### Question 2 ####

# Check how many items are in `intvec`.
# Then append the values 7, 14, and 8 to the vector `intvec`.
# Check the length of intvec again. What changed?

# Answer:
